# PyChat
A chat tool coded in Python.

First, you need to have installed in your server:
- Python 3.x
  - psycopg2: Python module to connect to PSQL
- PostgreSQL

You run tables.sql in order to create the tables in PostgreSQL. The main.py file is kept running in server, while the user.py is executed in client side.
